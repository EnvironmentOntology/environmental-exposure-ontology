comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if an organism were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the organism is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0010447 'response to acidic pH' instead.

Red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength of 580-700nm. Far red light is electromagnetic radiation of wavelength 700-800nm. An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

Also, if experimental data suggest that a gene product influences cell death indirectly, rather than being involved in the death process directly, consider annotating to a 'regulation' term.

Cortisone is a natural glucocorticoid steroid hormone that is metabolically convertible to cortisol. Cortisone is synthesized from cholesterol in the cortex of the adrenal gland under the stimulation of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). The main physiological effect of cortisone is on carbohydrate metabolism; it can stimulate increased glucose release from the liver, increased liver glycogen synthesis, and decreased utilization of glucose by the tissues."

def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a stimulus by the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid (rather than the acid acting as a proton donor). The acid chemical may be in gaseous, liquid or solid form." [GOC:go_curators, GOC:mah, Wikipedia:Acid]
comment: This term should be used to describe a response to a specific acid as a chemical. E.g., if a cell were responding to glutamate, then the response would be glutamate-specific; the cell is actually responding to the chemical structure of the anion portion of the dissociated acid. Note that this term is in the subset of terms that should not be used for direct gene product annotation. Instead, select a child term or, if no appropriate child term exists, please request a new term. Direct annotations to this term may be amended during annotation QC. If annotating experiments where an acid is playing a role as a proton donor, please annotate to GO:0071468 'cellular response to acidic pH' instead.
