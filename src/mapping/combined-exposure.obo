A plant treatment is the most specific,and may be a component of a plant growing condition, and the plant study type. The broadest classes are the plant study types where the terms can be used to identify the growth study facility. Each growth facility such as field study, growth chamber, green house etc is a environment on its own and it may also involve instances of biotic and abiotic treatments and different growing conditions.

comment: Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.

An example of this response is seen at the beginning of many plant species developmental stages. These include germination, and the point when cotyledon expansion is triggered. In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

In certain species these processes take place in response to absorption of red light by the pigment molecule phytochrome, but the signal can be reversed by exposure to far red light. During the initial phase the phytochrome molecule is only present in the red light absorbing form, but on absorption of red light it changes to a far red light absorbing form, triggering progress through development. An immediate short period of exposure to far red light entirely returns the pigment to its initial state and prevents triggering of the developmental process. A thirty minute break between red and subsequent far red light exposure renders the red light effect irreversible, and development then occurs regardless of whether far red light exposure subsequently occurs."

def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a corticosterone stimulus. Corticosterone is a 21 carbon steroid hormone of the corticosteroid type, produced in the cortex of the adrenal glands. In many species, corticosterone is the principal glucocorticoid, involved in regulation of fuel metabolism, immune reactions, and stress responses." [PMID:15240347]

def: "Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell or an organism (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a cortisone stimulus. Cortisone is a natural glucocorticoid steroid hormone that is metabolically convertible to cortisol. Cortisone is synthesized from cholesterol in the cortex of the adrenal gland under the stimulation of adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH). The main physiological effect of cortisone is on carbohydrate metabolism; it can stimulate increased glucose release from the liver, increased liver glycogen synthesis, and decreased utilization of glucose by the tissues."

comment: Pesticide are unique chemicals as they are intrinsically toxic for several biological targets, are deliberately spread into the environment, and their toxicity has a limited species selectivity. Pesticide toxicity depends on the compound family and is generally greater for the older compounds; in humans, they are responsible for acute poisonings as well as for long term health effects, including cancer and adverse effects on reproduction.

Following exposure to this agent, EGFR expression status can be determined and EGFR overexpressing tumor cells can be visualized using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

Upon administration, Ad-hCMV-Flt3L is transduced into tumor cells and Flt3L is expressed. Flt3L stimulates both the proliferation of dendritic cells (DCs) and their migration to the tumor site. Upon exposure to the tumor-associated antigens (TAA) released from dying glioma cells, which were killed by thymidine kinase-mediated valacyclovir-induced tumor cell death, the DCs initiate a specific immune response against any remaining TAA-expressing tumor cells.

This facilitates tissue regeneration by promoting cellular proliferation and migration, reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and altering the expression of extracellular matrix components and adhesion molecules. Altogether, this promotes wound healing and provides protection from damage due to thermal or radiation exposure. Keratin is an essential component in nails, hair and skin." [NCIT:C116717]

Upon intravenous administration of the anti-CD20 B9E9 scFv-SA fusion protein, this agent targets and binds to CD20-expressing tumor cells. Subsequently, a biotinylated N-acetylgalactosamine-containing clearing agent is administered, which binds to the streptavidin moiety of the unbound fusion protein and promotes its hepatic excretion. In turn, radiolabeled DOTA (1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetraacetic acid)-biotin is administered and, due to its small size, quickly distributes. The biotin moiety efficiently binds to the SA moiety of the bound fusion protein, which localizes the biotin-conjugated radionuclide to the tumor site. CD20, a tumor-associated antigen (TAA), is overexpressed on B-cell malignancies. PRIT increases both tumor uptake and renal elimination of the radionuclide conjugate as compared to conventional radioimmunotherapy (RIT), where the radioisotope is bound to the antibody before administration; this increases the dose of radionuclide delivered to the tumor while limiting radiation exposure for normal, healthy tissues."

Upon intravenous administration of the docetaxel-loaded nanopharmaceutical CRLX301, the nanoparticles are able to accumulate at the tumor site due to the unique characteristics of the tumor's vasculature, while avoiding normal, healthy tissue. In turn, CRLX301 is taken up by the tumor cell via macropinocytosis. Subsequently, docetaxel is slowly released into the cytoplasm where it binds to and stabilizes the beta-subunit of tubulin, thereby stabilizing microtubules and inhibiting microtubule disassembly. This prevents mitosis and results in cell death. Compared to the administration of docetaxel alone, this formulation is able to increase docetaxel's efficacy while avoiding systemic exposure, which minimizes its toxicity." [NCIT:C121539]

It is on the EPA's priority pollutant list. It is ubiquitous in the environment as a product of incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. It has been identified in surface and drinking water, ambient air, exhaust emissions, smoke of cigarettes and cigars, and in smoked foods and edible aquatic organisms. It is primarily used as an intermediate in the production of dyes, smoke screens, scintillation counter crystals, and in organic semiconductor research. Although a large body of literature exists on the toxicity of PAHs, data for anthracene are limited. Prolonged exposure causes variety of topical and systemic adverse reactions.

def: "Immediate hypersensitivity reaction - type I reaction, involves immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated release of chemical mediators from mast cells and basophils. Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-13, which then act on B cells to promote the production of antigen-specific IgE. Reexposure to the antigen can then result in the antigen binding to and cross-linking the bound IgE antibodies on the mast cells and basophils. This causes the release of preformed mediators (histamine, tryptase, tryptase, chemotactic factors), newly synthesized mediators (leukotrienes, prostaglandin, thromboxane, platelet-activating factor, adenosine, bradykinin), and cytokines from these cells that results in structural and functional changes to the affected tissue."

Another consequence of beta-lactam exposure results in the loss of lipoteichoic acids from the cell wall.

In addition, vacuolization of the tegumental syncytium and blebbing results in tegument disintegration, leads to antigen exposure and elicit host defense responses to the worm. The result is the formation of granulomas and phagocytosis." [NCIT:C47683]

After succinate linker is hydrolyzed in vivo, the active moiety SN-38 is released and selectively stabilizes topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes, thereby inhibiting religation of topoisomerase I-mediated single-stranded DNA breaks and inducing lethal double-stranded DNA breaks.

A substance extremely toxic to mammals, with a wide variation in sensitivity among species. Longer-term exposure of test mammals to lesser amounts can affect reproduction, cause birth defects, damage the liver and suppress the immune system. Several studies suggest that exposure to TCDD increases the risk of several types of cancer in people. Animal studies have also shown an increased risk of cancer from exposure to TCDD. The WHO and the USA DHHS have determined that TCDD is a human carcinogen. (NCI)" [NCIT:C864]

After oral administration, ALA is converted intracellularly into the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX). Upon exposure to light of appropriate wavelength (violet to blue range), excited PpIX emits a characteristic red fluorescence which could facilitate guided resection, and generates excited singlet oxygen molecules that could kill cells when appropriate laser dosage is applied. ALA is preferentially taken up by and accumulates in many types of cancer cells compared to normal, healthy cells. Consequently, cancer cells can be visualized and can be distinguished from normal, healthy cells." [NCIT:C99763]
